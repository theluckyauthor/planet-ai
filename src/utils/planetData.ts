This friendship is built on mutual growth and unwavering support, where both parties celebrate each other's triumphs and sit together in moments of despair without judgment. Whether family or chosen, this relationship feels sacred‚Äîa safe harbor where authenticity thrives. You share history, inside jokes, and unspoken understandings. However, its strength requires active nurturing: prioritizing time together, even during chaotic phases, and honoring the trust that's been carefully cultivated over years."
    },
    "mercury": {
        "dynamic": "Mercury embodies a friendship that sparks suddenly and burns brightly. This dynamic is electric, driven by spontaneity and intellectual curiosity. Conversations feel like brainstorming sessions‚Äîfull of wild ideas, debates, and revelations. While exhilarating, the bond thrives on novelty rather than depth. It's a relationship where you might spend hours dissecting a niche topic one week, then go silent for months without hurt feelings. The key is to let it evolve organically, resisting the urge to force commitment or cling to its initial intensity."
    },
    "venus": {
        "dynamic": "Venus symbolizes a mirror-like connection where vulnerability is the norm. Here, you share insecurities, dreams, and secrets without fear of judgment. This friend intuitively senses your moods and offers validation, not solutions. The dynamic is deeply healing but fragile‚Äîit requires reciprocity to avoid emotional burnout. You might spend nights whispering truths you've never voiced elsewhere, creating a private universe of mutual understanding. Protecting this space from external drama or one-sided sharing is crucial for its survival."
    },
    "earth": {
        "dynamic": "Earth represents a steady, no-frills friendship rooted in consistency. This person knows your coffee order, childhood traumas, and how you take your toast. Interactions feel like slipping into a worn-in sweater‚Äîcomfortable and reassuring. You might go weeks without talking, yet pick up exactly where you left off. The risk lies in taking this bond for granted; without occasional updates about personal growth, assumptions can fossilize, turning familiarity into stagnation."
    },
    "mars": {
        "dynamic": "Mars fuels a thrill-seeking partnership where boundaries are pushed. This friend dares you to quit your job, join a salsa class, or confront someone who wronged you. The dynamic is competitive in the healthiest way‚Äîyou inspire each other to grow bolder. However, the constant adrenaline can mask emotional needs. Without periodic check-ins to ground the relationship, it risks becoming a performance rather than a genuine connection."
    },
    "jupiter": {
        "dynamic": "Jupiter is the social catalyst who turns acquaintances into communities. This friend hosts dinners, introduces you to their vast network, and radiates infectious enthusiasm. While the bond feels expansive, it can prioritize quantity over depth. To sustain it, carve out one-on-one moments‚Äîlike coffee walks or late-night calls‚Äîwhere vulnerability replaces group banter. Otherwise, the relationship might plateau as a delightful yet surface-level connection."
    },
    "saturn": {
        "dynamic": "Saturn defines a situational friendship anchored in shared environments‚Äîwork, gym, or weekly classes. Your rapport flourishes within these contexts, fueled by mutual goals or routines. Outside that sphere, interactions feel tentative. To deepen it, gradually bridge the gap: share a personal struggle after a meeting or invite them to a non-contextual event. Without effort, the bond remains convenient but confined."
    },
    "uranus": {
        "dynamic": "Uranus governs a gloriously weird friendship where norms dissolve. Together, you invent absurd inside jokes, obsess over niche hobbies, or role-play in public just for laughs. This dynamic thrives on creativity and rebellion against mundanity. However, its chaotic energy can become draining if not balanced with quieter moments. Setting boundaries around the madness ensures it remains joyful rather than exhausting."
    },
    "neptune": {
        "dynamic": "Neptune embodies a transcendent connection that defies logic. You might live continents apart or speak sporadically, yet when you reunite, hours vanish into deep existential talks. This bond exists in a liminal space‚Äîless about physical presence than a shared wavelength. To maintain it, send sporadic signals (a song link, a meme) that say, 'I'm here, I get you.' Forcing regularity would dilute its magic."
    },
    "pluto": {
        "dynamic": "Pluto represents a friendship preserved in amber‚Äîonce transformative, now frozen in time. You've grown apart, but memories of late-night drives or shared struggles still ache with sweetness. Reconnecting often feels bittersweet; the person they were (and the person you were) still resonate, but present-day versions might clash. Honor the past without clinging, allowing gratitude to coexist with gentle release."
    },
    "comet": {
        "dynamic": "Comet symbolizes an on-again, off-again bond that reignites in fiery bursts. For a month, you're inseparable‚Äîtexting constantly, planning adventures‚Äîthen life intervenes, and contact dims. There's no resentment in the silence; both understand the pattern. This dynamic thrives on passion over consistency, offering intense connection without the pressure of daily maintenance. Embrace its ephemeral highs, but avoid relying on it for stability."
    },
    "moon": {
        "dynamic": "The Moon governs a low-effort yet profound friendship. You might exchange three texts a year, yet their mere existence comforts you. This person doesn't need updates‚Äîthey grasp your essence. The dynamic is autonomous; you orbit the same emotional truths without demanding proximity. A single 'saw this and thought of you' message carries disproportionate weight, reaffirming an unspoken pact of mutual understanding."
    },
    "cluster": {
        "dynamic": "Cluster represents a group dynamic where the whole outweighs individual parts. Your squad shares rituals‚Äîannual trips, themed parties, collective griefs. Alone, you might drift, but together, you're a force. This bond risks member turnover or diluted intimacy as lives shift. Combat this by creating new traditions and acknowledging individual growth within the collective identity."
    },
    "satellite": {
        "dynamic": "Satellite defines pleasant but shallow ties‚Äîyour barista, coworker, or dog park regular. Interactions are polite, predictable, and disposable. There's mutual acknowledgment without investment. This dynamic thrives on brevity; a smile or small-talk about the weather suffices. Overstepping into personal territory often feels intrusive, so honor its role as social background noise."
    },
    "forge": {
        "dynamic": "Forge symbolizes a mentorship-like bond focused on growth. This friend challenges your limits, calls out excuses, and refuses to coddle. The dynamic can feel abrasive but pushes you toward self-betterment. However, discern between tough love and toxicity. True 'forge' relationships balance criticism with unwavering belief in your potential."
    },
    "niche": {
        "dynamic": "Niche friendships orbit shared obsessions‚Äîmodular synths, medieval history, competitive knitting. Conversations dive deep into technicalities outsiders would find baffling. The bond exists in a bubble, often avoiding personal topics. To sustain it, nurture the shared passion through collaborative projects or events, resisting the urge to force broader connection."
    },
    "static": {
        "dynamic": "Static defines a turbulent, love-hate dynamic. You're drawn to their charisma but repelled by petty rivalries or snarky comments. Interactions swing between camaraderie and tension. This relationship often consumes more energy than it returns. Regularly assess its emotional ROI‚Äîsometimes, preserving peace means distancing, even if history makes it painful."
    },
    "dust": {
        "dynamic": "Dust encompasses obligatory relationships‚Äîyour aunt's neighbor, a partner's tedious friend. Interactions are transactional and draining, marked by forced smiles and mental countdowns. Maintain polite detachment: keep conversations weather-focused, avoid personal details, and exit at the first natural pause. Investing here yields little but exhaustion."
